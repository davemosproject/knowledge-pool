## Mobility as a service (Maas) {#maas}

### Definition {-}
In line with the principle of "*using instead of owning*", one goal of MaaS is to make mobility available as a service anytime and anywhere with a click on one or more online platforms or apps. These digital MaaS platforms or apps should link information, booking and payment of mobility offers from different service providers and thus enable the offer of integrated mobility packages. Users should have the freedom to choose between different physical forms of mobility (Neumann & Rauch, 2021):

-	public transport such as train, bus, rapid transit, tram and metro
-	private services such as taxis
-	services for car, ride, (e-)bike, (e-)scooter sharing or fixed route taxis
-	volunteer-run community buses
-	aircrafts and ships
-	(in the future) autonomous, driverless vehicles 

MaaS solutions can be built up in stages. The first stage consists of a bundling of information from different providers so that all available mobility offers are displayed for the entire journey from start to destination. Stage two includes planning routes according to customers' priorities and the possibility to book and pay for all means of transport used for the journey at once. In addition, real-time information for the route is included, such as changes in journey and waiting times due to unforeseen events - such as accidents or weather conditions – as well as continuous notifications about alternative options. Stage three consists of a mobility guarantee by means of a customised mobility package based on personal needs and preferences, e.g. in the form of a monthly subscription (Neumann & Rauch, 2021). <br/><br/>
The aim of MaaS is to provide an alternative to the private use of cars, thus equally convenient, even cheaper, but more sustainable (Maas Alliance, 2015). The theory of MaaS opens up new business areas and enables mobility service providers to increase their customer base. The usage data generated by the ongoing operation can help to get to know customers better and thus to work more efficiently, as it would be easier to plan the orientation and distribution of the services. A well-functioning MaaS system requires the willingness of private and public mobility providers to cooperate with each other and with the platform operators (MaaS providers) (Neumann & Rauch, 2021). Moreover, it relies heavily on availability of high-quality data. To enforce safe and secure real-time access to data , is equally important as ensuring the clarity regarding liabilities of parties with principal control over the data (Maas Alliance, 2015). The first step towards MaaS is the harmonization of data, supported by appropriate regulations and standards (Maas Alliance, 2015). In Austria, both researchers and mobility service providers are researching how to best implement MaaS. One example is the ULTIMOB research project.

### Key stakeholders {-}
- **Affected**: Customers/Users
- **Responsible**: Transport service providers and public transport operators, MaaS operators and integrators, IT system providers, city councils, local, regional and national authorities 

### Current state of art in research {-}
In order to support the cooperation between private and public mobility providers as well as platform operators (MaaS providers), the legal and organizational framework conditions as well as standards for a secure and fair exchange of data should be created at European and Austrian level (Neumann & Rauch, 2021). <br/><br/>
In 2015 the MaaS Alliance, a public-private partnership, working to establish foundations for a common approach to MaaS, was founded, with the main goal, to facilitate a single, open market and full deployment of MaaS services (Maas Alliance, 2015). <br/>
The research and development project *MaaS4EU*, which is funded by the Horizon2020 research and innovation programme, brings together 17 partners from several sectors and backgrounds to provide viable evidence and solutions about the MaaS concept. The project aims to remove barriers and enable a cooperative and interconnected EU single transport market for the MaaS concept, by addressing the four pillars: 

(1) business models
(2) end-users
(3) technology
(4) policy

Therefore, the holistic *MaaS4EU* solutions are demonstrated and validated in real life via Living Labs in Greater Manchester (UK), Luxembourg-Germany, and Budapest (Hungary) (MaaS4EU, 2017). In summmary, current research is mainly working on the development of different MaaS app/platform prototypes, that will offer a multimodal travel solution. One example is the project *TrønderMaaS* of Marinelli et al. (2020) who is operating a full-scale pilot test in the Trondheim-Stjørdal region, Norway. 
### Current state of art in practice {-}
In 2019 Berlin’s public transport authority *Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG)* invented and implemented together with the Lithuanian start-up and MaaS solution leader *Trafi* the mobility app called *Jelbi*, which counts as the world’s most extensive Mobility as a Service-solution (Rastenytė, 2020). The app covers assistance planning and routes discovery, real-time public transport information and shared mobility vehicle location and availability, a streamlined payment solution for any integrated mobility service, as well as the possibility to compare the duration and cost of each trip (Rastenytė, 2020). <br/>

In 2020, Switzerland followed and integrated an app called *yumuv*. *Swiss Federal Railways SBB CFF FFS, PTOs of Verkehrsbetriebe Zürich, Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB)*, and *BERNMOBIL* cooperated also with the start-up *Trafi* and managed to create the first regional MaaS with subscriptions (Trafi Ltd., 2020).

## Park and ride {#p_r}

### Synonyms {-}
*P&R, P and R, P+R*

### Definition {-}
Some of the main challenges the world is currently facing are related to population growth and urbanisation. The massive growth of cities has created major transport challenges that manifest themselves in traffic congestion in urban areas, especially in city centres. Many of the efforts to reduce congestion attempt to increase vehicle occupancy by inducing a shift from single occupancy vehicles (SOVs) to multiple occupancy vehicles or encouraging use of various transit modes. One example of such effort are park-and-ride facilities which attempt to reduce car use and increase road efficiency.<br/><br/>
Park-and-ride facilities are usually located in peri-urban areas in a proximity to bus or train station to allow drivers coming from suburban and rural areas to park their cars and transfer to public transport to reach urban destinations. Park-and-ride facilities, introduced in England in the 1970s, appear to offer a simple and cost-effective alternative to building new roads. These facilities are usually accompanied by good public transport services to urban areas (Katoshevski-Cavari, Bak and Shiftan, 2018).

### Key stakeholders {-}

- **Affected**: Car drivers coming from suburban and rural areas 
- **Responsible**: National Governments, Communal Governments, City governments, Parking Companies

### Current state of art in research {-}
In terms of P&R research, existing publications address topics such as the optimal location problem of P&R facilities, the relationship between private vehicle use patterns and the number and density of P&R facilities in a city, the empirical study of P&R facility use patterns, the study of P&R motives and air quality standards in Europe, the influence of P&R facilities on vehicle kilometres travelled, the analysis of travellers' stated intention to use parking and cycling facilities (P+R, B+R), empirical analysis of P&R facility choice behaviour, attitude surveys of P&R and non-P&R users and the influence of multimodal information on the use of P&R (Gan and Ye, 2018).<br/><br/>
Studies show that some public transport users were attracted to switch to multiple modes of transport (i.e. park-and-ride), which increased the number of car trips. Nonetheless, additional car trips are made in non-congested areas, thus contributing to traffic relief (Katoshevski-Cavari, Bak and Shiftan, 2018).<br/><br/>
The exact effects of P&R are controversial. Some studies have confirmed that P&R facilities can encourage the use of public transport, relieve urban traffic and reduce car emissions in city centres. Other studies pointed to possible counter-effects of P&R. The reduction of congestion in city centres might encourage motorists to use their cars in the city again, as accessibility has increased, and motorists travelling to the city centre via P&R facilities might travel some extra kilometres to reach the P&R facility. The exact weight of these negative externalities is still debatable (and will vary from place to place), as is the direct net benefit of P&R on car traffic in the city area as a whole. However, it is undisputed that well-used P&R facilities directly reduce car traffic in the city centre (Dijk and Montalvo, 2011).


### Current state of art in practice {-}
Parking management has evolved greatly in Europe over the last decades, and P&R has emerged as one of the newest elements of urban parking management. Virtually all urban areas are facing growing parking demand. More parking spaces lead to growing problems of urban congestion and pollution from traffic. Many cities have responded with policies aimed at improving the utilisation of existing infrastructure (e.g. through pricing or automatic display of parking capacity) and building new infrastructure at structural bottlenecks. The typical development of urban parking policies can be presented in seven phases (Dijk and Montalvo, 2011):

1.	**No parking measures**: This phase is sustainable until the level of parked cars has a negative impact on the attractiveness and quality of the area.
2.	**Regulation and control of parking**: This means banning parking in some streets.
3.	**Time restrictions (free of charge)**: This leads to more efficient use of available space through increased turnover of cars.
4.	**Paid parking**. Parking tariffs are used as a key to control the use of parking spaces.
5.	**Resident parking schemes**: Overflow of parkers into neighbouring areas (often residential) requires resident parking regulations.
6.	**P&R facilities**: These are being developed as an alternative or supplement to parking provision in the town centre.
7.	**Mobility management**: It includes various activities to coordinate the combination of private and public transport to create an acceptable mobility chain for travellers.

Moreover, the results of a survey show that a quarter of the cities in Europe are intensively engaged in P + R development, while the other half are moderately engaged. Geographically, it shows that cities in north-western Europe have a higher level of engagement than cities in southern and eastern Europe. Furthermore, the understanding of P&R in European cities is strongly different, revealing current beliefs about P&R. 
Park-and-Ride is certainly not the only transport policy initiative in the city to improve accessibility and quality of life in the city. Most cities apply combination of measures. P&R is valued as part of such a package, but not seen as the perfect package. Most cities consider P&R as a "Plan B" (Dijk and Montalvo, 2011).<br/><br/>
In Germany, some P&R facilities were tested by the ADAC. Many P&R facilities had deficiencies - most of them were missing equipment features:

-	The testers hardly found any video surveillance, and forecasts of occupancy on the Internet were also scarce;
-	No car park had continuous footpaths and safe separation between pedestrians and cars;
-	In 25% of facilities, there were not enough parking spaces available, showing a gap between supply and demand. 
-	Some of the public transport services were also unsatisfactory, with too long waiting/transfer time. The likelihood of choosing P + R facility decreases with longer public transport travel and waiting times (Islam et al., 2015).

The facilities scored best in the category of information and prices. Two thirds had clear signage and provided comprehensible information on their websites about location, size and prices. Two of them were particularly positive: they published online forecasts of available parking spaces so that drivers could estimate in advance when parking spaces would be available. The Bremen-Burg P&R facility offered additional useful service: a display board showed free parking spaces and the departure times of the next two trains. 
In passenger traffic, commuters do not want to wait long for their train. The frequency of public transport therefore has a significant impact on whether a P&R facility is accepted at all. In one third of the facilities, the connection to the public transport network (travel time ratio, frequency, routes to the station) was poor or very poor. 
The testers checked lighting, digital or personal surveillance, recognisable separation between parking spaces and the roadway, and whether the transition from the car park to the station was safe. Overall, the study showed that current level of safety is unsatisfactory.<br/>

Recommendations for operators:

-	Provide information about P&R facilities on the Internet
-	Pave, regularly maintain and clean the entire P&R facility - including temporary parking spaces.
-	Make parking spaces at least 2.50 metres wide so that users can get on and off without difficulty.
-	Keep footpaths short and safely separated from the roadway, clearly mark parking spaces and regularly tighten faded markings.
-	Provide charging infrastructure for electric vehicles
-	In multi-storey car parks, provide more security through video surveillance, good visibility, functioning emergency calls and comprehensive lighting
-	Manage P&R facilities at high occupancy rates (user fees, parking time restrictions) in order to avoid misuse.

Recommendations for municipalities & public transport:

-	Planning on a large scale and regionally already when developing areas for P&R facilities.
-	Where demand is particularly high and space is available, create more P&R spaces - possibly also by building parking decks.
-	Ensure good public transport connections to the city centre with short intervals.
-	Avoid large jumps in fares, if necessary integrate selected P&R facilities into cheaper fare groups.
-	Combine Bike+Ride and P&R facilities to make it possible for residents from the immediate vicinity to reach the facility by bicycle instead of by car (Luca and Dommnich, 2018).

### Relevant initiatives in Austria {-}
ÖBB is investing 700 million euros in the expansion of infrastructure in the eastern region this year. Two thirds of rail passengers in Austria travel in Lower Austria, Vienna and Burgenland, where lines are being extended, stations renovated and new park-and-ride facilities built (Frey, 2021). In Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland, more than 40,000 parking spaces are available at over 200 Park/B+R facilities for easy transfers. In Vienna, most P&R facilities charge a small fee of € 3.60 per day. In Lower Austria and Burgenland, the use of P&R facilities is free of charge for public transport passengers (VOR.at, no date).

## Contactless public transport cards {#contactless_cards}

### Synonyms {-}
*Contactless smart card, smart card ticketing*

### Definition {-}
Smart card ticketing means, that the passenger's entitlement to travel is stored electronically on a chip that is usually embedded in a plastic card and validated when the card is presented to a smart reader (Turner & Wilson, 2010). On the contrary to contact smart cards, which have to be inserted into a smart card reader, contactless smart cards must only be near to the readers (about 10 cm) to exchange data (Mezghani, 2008). There are three types of standards used, called Type A, Type B (both complying with ISO 14443 standard) and FeliCa, while FeliCa provides faster transmission and is mainly used in Asian countries (Kurauchi & Schmöcker, 2017). <br/><br/>
Smart and integrated ticketing systems are expected to deliver greater flexibility and simplicity for passengers, by offering increased speed, convenience and security against loss and theft (Turner & Wilson, 2010). Economic and societal benefits from smart cards ticketing include the reduction in costs as a result of fewer paper tickets being sold, reduced queuing time, faster throughput of passengers at ticket gates, reduced boarding time for buses and reduced loss of revenue through fraud (Turner & Wilson, 2010). <br/><br/>
England’s Department of Transport has planned a strategy, to introduce integrated and smart ticketing to the majority of the UK by 2020. Their research suggests that net annual benefits of over £1 billion per year to passengers, operators and local authorities can be the result (Turner & Wilson, 2010). 
Another advantage of using smart cards ticketing, is the large amount of data on passengers’ behaviour, which can be collected with lower cost (Kurauchi & Schmöcker, 2017). In Austria smart cards have not been implemented on a large scale. Only the City of Wales has smart cards for the public transport in use (Wels Linien). ÖBB (ÖBB, 2021) and Wiener Linien (Wiener Linien, 2021) don’t have smart cards in use, but online tickets for smart phones, using QR Codes. Wiener Linien are currently researching on a more efficient solution for the usage of digital tickets, since they developed, that ticket controls of digital tickets take longer than for paper tickets (Wiener Linien, 2021b). 

### Key stakeholders {-}

- **Affected**: Public transport users, ticket inspectors 
- **Responsible**: Public transport operators, public transport associations, public transport authorities, smart card producers, Industry suppliers

### Current state of art in research {-}
The latest research goes in the direction of using smart phones or other mobile devices for smart ticketing.  An initiative, led by NFC Forum and GSMA achieved in 2015 together with global public transport representatives, the Smart Ticketing Alliance and the JR East as well as standards bodies, including CEN and ISO, harmonizing the specifications of mobile device NFC interfaces and public transport readers and cards. Together they established standards for testing mobile devices and public transport equipment (NFC Forum, 2016). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, , out.width="90%", fig.cap="The evolution of mobile ticketing (NFC Forum, 2016)"}
knitr::include_graphics("image/smart_cards.png")
```

Furthermore current research addresses the issues of big data and how collected data through contactless smart cards can be best analysed (see Kurauchi & Schmöcker, 2017).

### Current state of art in practice {-}
Many countries, regions or cities, have smart card ticketing systems in use, like the whole of Netherlands, Helsinki Region, Minsk, Berlin, Auckland, Sydney and many more (see Wikipedia contributors, 2021). The systems itself differ and depend on the local ticketing and fare systems. While London, for instance, is using an access control system, Helsinki's system is trust based. Furthermore, a distinction can be made between pre-paid (debit) and post-paid (credit) systems (Kurauchi & Schmöcker, 2017).
