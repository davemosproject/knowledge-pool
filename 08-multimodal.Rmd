## Mobility as a service (Maas) {#maas}

### Definition {-}
In line with the principle of "*using instead of owning*", one goal of MaaS is to make mobility available as a service anytime and anywhere with a click on one or more online platforms or apps. These digital MaaS platforms or apps should link information, booking and payment of mobility offers from different service providers and thus enable the offer of integrated mobility packages. Users should have the freedom to choose between different physical forms of mobility (Neumann & Rauch, 2021):

-	public transport such as train, bus, rapid transit, tram and metro
-	private services such as taxis
-	services for car, ride, (e-)bike, (e-)scooter sharing or fixed route taxis
-	volunteer-run community buses
-	aircrafts and ships
-	(in the future) autonomous, driverless vehicles 

MaaS solutions can be built up in stages. The first stage consists of a bundling of information from different providers so that all available mobility offers are displayed for the entire journey from start to destination. Stage two includes planning routes according to customers' priorities and the possibility to book and pay for all means of transport used for the journey at once. In addition, real-time information for the route is included, such as changes in journey and waiting times due to unforeseen events - such as accidents or weather conditions – as well as continuous notifications about alternative options. Stage three consists of a mobility guarantee by means of a customised mobility package based on personal needs and preferences, e.g. in the form of a monthly subscription (Neumann & Rauch, 2021). <br/><br/>
The aim of MaaS is to provide an alternative to the private use of cars, thus equally convenient, even cheaper, but more sustainable (Maas Alliance, 2015). The theory of MaaS opens up new business areas and enables mobility service providers to increase their customer base. The usage data generated by the ongoing operation can help to get to know customers better and thus to work more efficiently, as it would be easier to plan the orientation and distribution of the services. A well-functioning MaaS system requires the willingness of private and public mobility providers to cooperate with each other and with the platform operators (MaaS providers) (Neumann & Rauch, 2021). Moreover, it relies heavily on availability of high-quality data. To enforce safe and secure real-time access to data , is equally important as ensuring the clarity regarding liabilities of parties with principal control over the data (Maas Alliance, 2015). The first step towards MaaS is the harmonization of data, supported by appropriate regulations and standards (Maas Alliance, 2015). In Austria, both researchers and mobility service providers are researching how to best implement MaaS. One example is the ULTIMOB research project.

### Key stakeholders {-}
- **Affected**: Customers/Users
- **Responsible**: Transport service providers and public transport operators, MaaS operators and integrators, IT system providers, city councils, local, regional and national authorities 

### Current state of art in research {-}
In order to support the cooperation between private and public mobility providers as well as platform operators (MaaS providers), the legal and organizational framework conditions as well as standards for a secure and fair exchange of data should be created at European and Austrian level (Neumann & Rauch, 2021). <br/><br/>
In 2015 the MaaS Alliance, a public-private partnership, working to establish foundations for a common approach to MaaS, was founded, with the main goal, to facilitate a single, open market and full deployment of MaaS services (Maas Alliance, 2015). <br/>
The research and development project *MaaS4EU*, which is funded by the Horizon2020 research and innovation programme, brings together 17 partners from several sectors and backgrounds to provide viable evidence and solutions about the MaaS concept. The project aims to remove barriers and enable a cooperative and interconnected EU single transport market for the MaaS concept, by addressing the four pillars: 

(1) business models
(2) end-users
(3) technology
(4) policy

Therefore, the holistic *MaaS4EU* solutions are demonstrated and validated in real life via Living Labs in Greater Manchester (UK), Luxembourg-Germany, and Budapest (Hungary) (MaaS4EU, 2017). In summmary, current research is mainly working on the development of different MaaS app/platform prototypes, that will offer a multimodal travel solution. One example is the project *TrønderMaaS* of Marinelli et al. (2020) who is operating a full-scale pilot test in the Trondheim-Stjørdal region, Norway. 

### Current state of art in practice {-}
In 2019 Berlin’s public transport authority *Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG)* invented and implemented together with the Lithuanian start-up and MaaS solution leader *Trafi* the mobility app called *Jelbi*, which counts as the world’s most extensive Mobility as a Service-solution (Rastenytė, 2020). The app covers assistance planning and routes discovery, real-time public transport information and shared mobility vehicle location and availability, a streamlined payment solution for any integrated mobility service, as well as the possibility to compare the duration and cost of each trip (Rastenytė, 2020). <br/>

In 2020, Switzerland followed and integrated an app called *yumuv*. *Swiss Federal Railways SBB CFF FFS, PTOs of Verkehrsbetriebe Zürich, Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVB)*, and *BERNMOBIL* cooperated also with the start-up *Trafi* and managed to create the first regional MaaS with subscriptions (Trafi Ltd., 2020).

## Park and ride {#p_r}

### Synonyms {-}
*P&R, P and R, P+R*

### Definition {-}
Some of the main challenges the world is currently facing are related to population growth and urbanisation. The massive growth of cities has created major transport challenges that manifest themselves in traffic congestion in urban areas, especially in city centres. Many of the efforts to reduce congestion attempt to increase vehicle occupancy by inducing a shift from single occupancy vehicles (SOVs) to multiple occupancy vehicles or encouraging use of various transit modes. One example of such effort are park-and-ride facilities which attempt to reduce car use and increase road efficiency.<br/><br/>
Park-and-ride facilities are usually located in peri-urban areas in a proximity to bus or train station to allow drivers coming from suburban and rural areas to park their cars and transfer to public transport to reach urban destinations. Park-and-ride facilities, introduced in England in the 1970s, appear to offer a simple and cost-effective alternative to building new roads. These facilities are usually accompanied by good public transport services to urban areas (Katoshevski-Cavari, Bak and Shiftan, 2018).

### Key stakeholders {-}

- **Affected**: Car drivers coming from suburban and rural areas 
- **Responsible**: National Governments, Communal Governments, City governments, Parking Companies

### Current state of art in research {-}
In terms of P&R research, existing publications address topics such as the optimal location problem of P&R facilities, the relationship between private vehicle use patterns and the number and density of P&R facilities in a city, the empirical study of P&R facility use patterns, the study of P&R motives and air quality standards in Europe, the influence of P&R facilities on vehicle kilometres travelled, the analysis of travellers' stated intention to use parking and cycling facilities (P+R, B+R), empirical analysis of P&R facility choice behaviour, attitude surveys of P&R and non-P&R users and the influence of multimodal information on the use of P&R (Gan and Ye, 2018).<br/><br/>
Studies show that some public transport users were attracted to switch to multiple modes of transport (i.e. park-and-ride), which increased the number of car trips. Nonetheless, additional car trips are made in non-congested areas, thus contributing to traffic relief (Katoshevski-Cavari, Bak and Shiftan, 2018).<br/><br/>
The exact effects of P&R are controversial. Some studies have confirmed that P&R facilities can encourage the use of public transport, relieve urban traffic and reduce car emissions in city centres. Other studies pointed to possible counter-effects of P&R. The reduction of congestion in city centres might encourage motorists to use their cars in the city again, as accessibility has increased, and motorists travelling to the city centre via P&R facilities might travel some extra kilometres to reach the P&R facility. The exact weight of these negative externalities is still debatable (and will vary from place to place), as is the direct net benefit of P&R on car traffic in the city area as a whole. However, it is undisputed that well-used P&R facilities directly reduce car traffic in the city centre (Dijk and Montalvo, 2011).


### Current state of art in practice {-}
Parking management has evolved greatly in Europe over the last decades, and P&R has emerged as one of the newest elements of urban parking management. Virtually all urban areas are facing growing parking demand. More parking spaces lead to growing problems of urban congestion and pollution from traffic. Many cities have responded with policies aimed at improving the utilisation of existing infrastructure (e.g. through pricing or automatic display of parking capacity) and building new infrastructure at structural bottlenecks. The typical development of urban parking policies can be presented in seven phases (Dijk and Montalvo, 2011):

1.	**No parking measures**: This phase is sustainable until the level of parked cars has a negative impact on the attractiveness and quality of the area.
2.	**Regulation and control of parking**: This means banning parking in some streets.
3.	**Time restrictions (free of charge)**: This leads to more efficient use of available space through increased turnover of cars.
4.	**Paid parking**. Parking tariffs are used as a key to control the use of parking spaces.
5.	**Resident parking schemes**: Overflow of parkers into neighbouring areas (often residential) requires resident parking regulations.
6.	**P&R facilities**: These are being developed as an alternative or supplement to parking provision in the town centre.
7.	**Mobility management**: It includes various activities to coordinate the combination of private and public transport to create an acceptable mobility chain for travellers.

Moreover, the results of a survey show that a quarter of the cities in Europe are intensively engaged in P + R development, while the other half are moderately engaged. Geographically, it shows that cities in north-western Europe have a higher level of engagement than cities in southern and eastern Europe. Furthermore, the understanding of P&R in European cities is strongly different, revealing current beliefs about P&R. 
Park-and-Ride is certainly not the only transport policy initiative in the city to improve accessibility and quality of life in the city. Most cities apply combination of measures. P&R is valued as part of such a package, but not seen as the perfect package. Most cities consider P&R as a "Plan B" (Dijk and Montalvo, 2011).<br/><br/>
In Germany, some P&R facilities were tested by the ADAC. Many P&R facilities had deficiencies - most of them were missing equipment features:

-	The testers hardly found any video surveillance, and forecasts of occupancy on the Internet were also scarce;
-	No car park had continuous footpaths and safe separation between pedestrians and cars;
-	In 25% of facilities, there were not enough parking spaces available, showing a gap between supply and demand. 
-	Some of the public transport services were also unsatisfactory, with too long waiting/transfer time. The likelihood of choosing P + R facility decreases with longer public transport travel and waiting times (Islam et al., 2015).

The facilities scored best in the category of information and prices. Two thirds had clear signage and provided comprehensible information on their websites about location, size and prices. Two of them were particularly positive: they published online forecasts of available parking spaces so that drivers could estimate in advance when parking spaces would be available. The Bremen-Burg P&R facility offered additional useful service: a display board showed free parking spaces and the departure times of the next two trains. 
In passenger traffic, commuters do not want to wait long for their train. The frequency of public transport therefore has a significant impact on whether a P&R facility is accepted at all. In one third of the facilities, the connection to the public transport network (travel time ratio, frequency, routes to the station) was poor or very poor. 
The testers checked lighting, digital or personal surveillance, recognisable separation between parking spaces and the roadway, and whether the transition from the car park to the station was safe. Overall, the study showed that current level of safety is unsatisfactory.<br/>

Recommendations for operators:

-	Provide information about P&R facilities on the Internet
-	Pave, regularly maintain and clean the entire P&R facility - including temporary parking spaces.
-	Make parking spaces at least 2.50 metres wide so that users can get on and off without difficulty.
-	Keep footpaths short and safely separated from the roadway, clearly mark parking spaces and regularly tighten faded markings.
-	Provide charging infrastructure for electric vehicles
-	In multi-storey car parks, provide more security through video surveillance, good visibility, functioning emergency calls and comprehensive lighting
-	Manage P&R facilities at high occupancy rates (user fees, parking time restrictions) in order to avoid misuse.

Recommendations for municipalities & public transport:

-	Planning on a large scale and regionally already when developing areas for P&R facilities.
-	Where demand is particularly high and space is available, create more P&R spaces - possibly also by building parking decks.
-	Ensure good public transport connections to the city centre with short intervals.
-	Avoid large jumps in fares, if necessary integrate selected P&R facilities into cheaper fare groups.
-	Combine Bike+Ride and P&R facilities to make it possible for residents from the immediate vicinity to reach the facility by bicycle instead of by car (Luca and Dommnich, 2018).

### Relevant initiatives in Austria {-}
ÖBB is investing 700 million euros in the expansion of infrastructure in the eastern region this year. Two thirds of rail passengers in Austria travel in Lower Austria, Vienna and Burgenland, where lines are being extended, stations renovated and new park-and-ride facilities built (Frey, 2021). In Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland, more than 40,000 parking spaces are available at over 200 Park/B+R facilities for easy transfers. In Vienna, most P&R facilities charge a small fee of € 3.60 per day. In Lower Austria and Burgenland, the use of P&R facilities is free of charge for public transport passengers (VOR.at, no date).

## Contactless public transport cards {#contactless_cards}

### Synonyms {-}
*Contactless smart card, smart card ticketing*

### Definition {-}
Smart card ticketing means, that the passenger's entitlement to travel is stored electronically on a chip that is usually embedded in a plastic card and validated when the card is presented to a smart reader (Turner & Wilson, 2010). On the contrary to contact smart cards, which have to be inserted into a smart card reader, contactless smart cards must only be near to the readers (about 10 cm) to exchange data (Mezghani, 2008). There are three types of standards used, called Type A, Type B (both complying with ISO 14443 standard) and FeliCa, while FeliCa provides faster transmission and is mainly used in Asian countries (Kurauchi & Schmöcker, 2017). <br/><br/>
Smart and integrated ticketing systems are expected to deliver greater flexibility and simplicity for passengers, by offering increased speed, convenience and security against loss and theft (Turner & Wilson, 2010). Economic and societal benefits from smart cards ticketing include the reduction in costs as a result of fewer paper tickets being sold, reduced queuing time, faster throughput of passengers at ticket gates, reduced boarding time for buses and reduced loss of revenue through fraud (Turner & Wilson, 2010). <br/><br/>
England’s Department of Transport has planned a strategy, to introduce integrated and smart ticketing to the majority of the UK by 2020. Their research suggests that net annual benefits of over £1 billion per year to passengers, operators and local authorities can be the result (Turner & Wilson, 2010). 
Another advantage of using smart cards ticketing, is the large amount of data on passengers’ behaviour, which can be collected with lower cost (Kurauchi & Schmöcker, 2017). In Austria smart cards have not been implemented on a large scale. Only the City of Wales has smart cards for the public transport in use (Wels Linien). ÖBB (ÖBB, 2021) and Wiener Linien (Wiener Linien, 2021) don’t have smart cards in use, but online tickets for smart phones, using QR Codes. Wiener Linien are currently researching on a more efficient solution for the usage of digital tickets, since they developed, that ticket controls of digital tickets take longer than for paper tickets (Wiener Linien, 2021b). 

### Key stakeholders {-}

- **Affected**: Public transport users, ticket inspectors 
- **Responsible**: Public transport operators, public transport associations, public transport authorities, smart card producers, Industry suppliers

### Current state of art in research {-}
The latest research goes in the direction of using smart phones or other mobile devices for smart ticketing.  An initiative, led by NFC Forum and GSMA achieved in 2015 together with global public transport representatives, the Smart Ticketing Alliance and the JR East as well as standards bodies, including CEN and ISO, harmonizing the specifications of mobile device NFC interfaces and public transport readers and cards. Together they established standards for testing mobile devices and public transport equipment (NFC Forum, 2016). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, , out.width="90%", fig.cap="The evolution of mobile ticketing (NFC Forum, 2016)"}
knitr::include_graphics("image/smart_cards.png")
```

Furthermore current research addresses the issues of big data and how collected data through contactless smart cards can be best analysed (see Kurauchi & Schmöcker, 2017).

### Current state of art in practice {-}
Many countries, regions or cities, have smart card ticketing systems in use, like the whole of Netherlands, Helsinki Region, Minsk, Berlin, Auckland, Sydney and many more (see Wikipedia contributors, 2021). The systems itself differ and depend on the local ticketing and fare systems. While London, for instance, is using an access control system, Helsinki's system is trust based. Furthermore, a distinction can be made between pre-paid (debit) and post-paid (credit) systems (Kurauchi & Schmöcker, 2017).

## Information and assistance for people with special needs {#special_needs}
### Synonyms {-}

*Assistive technology*

### Definition {-}
Vehmas (2010: 92) defines that having a special need *"...implies that an individual has the kind of characteristics that it is unlikely, or at least uncertain, whether he or she would achieve the aim that defines the need in question without special instruction, procedures that are out of ordinary."* Special needs can therefore mean a mobility limitation due to age or any type of disability. 

Furthermore, *"Assistive technology refers to any system, services, appliances or devices that could be used to help disabled people with their daily life by removing some barriers to activities."* (Low et al., 2020).

Because the types of disabilities are diverse and so are the specific needs, Low et al. (2020) argue that more specific measures should be taken to meet the particular needs of specific disabilities rather than generalizing the types of assistive devices available. The requirements regarding traffic systems for people with special needs can be divided into *(1)* visual impairment, *(2)* hearing impairment, *(3)* mobility impairment, and *(4)* mental impairment. While for some people with special needs only one may be applicable, the elderly people might depend upon more than one or even all. <br/>

Low et al. (2020) argue, that especially people with visual impairment (VIP) are dependent on public transport, because they cannot drive vehicles themselves, which leads to a restriction of freedom of movement. The same applies to many people with limited mobility who are excluded from active participation in motorized individual transport. Limited access to travel information is often a barrier to independent travel and other daily activities for people with special needs. When using public transportation, the choice of route is influenced by the reliability and availability of information, as well as convenience and comfort. However simply gathering this information before a trip can often be a problem for VIPs, as a lot of information is printed. However, the current trend towards online materials is helping. Due to physical and mental conditions, especially old or disabled people might need some extra information, for example, many older people cannot stand for long, are sensitive to weather conditions, cannot do things quickly or cannot walk long distances (Hounsell et al., 2016). A lack of usable information can add a negative aspect to the overall experience and actually prevent a trip. <br/>

In addition, Low et al. (2020) argue, that bus riding poses several challenges for VIPs, such as finding the right bus, which is especially problematic when multiple bus stops are at the same station. The mix of fleets used makes it difficult for VIPs to identify the characteristics of a bus. Furthermore, it is often difficult for VIPs to locate the boarding point for buses. Regarding trains, the gap between the train and the platform can be a barrier. An important part of public transport are audio announcements, which serve as a source of information for VIPs. If these systems fail, the journey is perceived as particularly stressful. <br/>

To overcome barriers at the ticket buying, the implementation of contactless card systems (see [Contactless public transport cards section](#contactless_cards)) or free passes for disabled people can help (Low et al., 2020). 


### Key stakeholders {-}

- **Affected**: People with special needs, elderly population, care takers
- **Responsible**: Transport service providers and public transport operators, MaaS operators and integrators, IT system providers, city councils, local, regional and national authorities, public transport associations, industry suppliers, Association for the Blind, Association for the Disabled

### Current state of art in research {-}
The study by Low et al. (2020) reflects, among other things, VIPs' desire to be independent in planning their trips by using online resources rather than seeking help from others. This shows the importance of having appropriate online tools for VIPs. Interviewees mentioned that they need to use many different sources and apps to plan a single trip, which in turn causes a lot of stress and decreases the propensity to the use of public transport. In addition, VIPs were found to lack access to current policies and information on available assistance. Furthermore, it was pointed out, that a similar interior design of buses would be extremely helpful for VIP and increase safety.<br/>

Goldberg et al. (2018) looked into the needs of VIPs for orientation, navigation and mobility. Based on their findings, they propose *"an integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) framework with 'Agents' and 'Smart Environments' to address VIP's ONM needs in urban settings."* Fusco & Coughlan (2020) described *"a computer vision approach to indoor localization that runs as a real-time app on a conventional smart-phone, which is intended to support a full-featured wayfinding app in the future that will include turn-by-turn directions."* One advantage of this approach is that no new infrastructure is needed, just a working smartphone with a built-in camera.<br/>

Hounsell et al. (2016) addressed information needs of older people particularly using public transport. Among other things, they found that elderly people *“may need larger font displays and primary data only, while mobility impaired people may need information on walking distances and the existence of gradient, steps, seats, etc."* By reviewing international cases of open data implementation, they found examples of authorities initiating the market by running competitions to develop apps for targeted groups such as older or disabled people. 

### Current state of art in practice {-}
One of the common assistive tools available to VIP are mobility tools, in particular a long cane or a guide dog. GPS is used as an assistive technology for VIP for orientation purposes and as a navigation aid. It can also be integrated into other devices to help VIP with orientation, such as a GPS-based voice alarm system that alerts VIP to nearby obstacles (Low et al., 2020). *BlindSquare* is one of the most popular GPS apps in the world for blind and visually impaired people. It describes the surroundings, warns about street intersections and important points as one moves along. Used in conjunction with external free navigation apps, *BlindSquare* provides almost all the information blind and visually impaired people need to be independent on the road. *BlindSquare* determines the location using the smartphone's GPS capabilities and retrieves information about the surrounding area on Foursquare and Open Street Map. Thanks to its unique algorithms, it determines the most relevant information and states it clearly in an artificial voice (BlindSquare., n.d.). A similar app is *Seeing Assistant Move*, which is based on Google Maps and also works offline and with voice control (Transition Technologies S.A., n.d.). Using public transport audio announcements plays a crucial role in helping VIP to be prepared to alight from the vehicle (Low et al., 2020).<br/>

Induction hearing systems or induction hearing loops are used to provide people with hearing problems with auditory information. The principle is based on special cables, the so-called induction loop, which is operated by an induction amplifier that converts the signals coming from the microphone and feeds them into the loop as a current. This current, in turn, creates a weak magnetic field in the coil in the room, which pulses in rhythm with the speech. This weak magnetic field is picked up by the hearing aid's T-coil, similar to an antenna, and converted back into audible sound vibrations. Almost no background noise is transmitted and the desired information can thus be heard without interference, almost in HIFI quality (Sturma, 2011). <br/>

To ensure accessibility for people with limited mobility in buses, more and more cities are focusing on the use of low-floor vehicles that can be lowered further hydraulically if required. The low entrance height makes boarding and alighting much easier, especially for older people and passengers with baby carriages or wheelchair users. Tramway equipment is also constantly being improved. Modern cars have more space for passengers with wheelchairs or baby carriages and a retractable ramp to bridge the already minimized gap between the platform edge and the vehicle (Wiener Linien, n.d.). As in Vienna, for example, real-time displays at stations can use a wheelchair symbol to indicate whether the expected public transport vehicles are barrier-free. <br/>

Finally, for example in Singaporean buses were introduced amenities for the convenience of pregnant, elderly and young passengers in the form of designated priority seats, low floors along the entire bus and low steps at the entrance and exit to facilitate individuals with limited mobility to board the bus quickly as well as move along the bus more easily (Smrt.com.sg, 2021).

## Mobility hubs {#mobility_hubs}

## Rail telematics for passengers and freight {#rail_telematics}

### Synonyms {-}
*Telematics Applications for Freight services (TAF), Telematics Applications for Passenger services (TAP), Technical Specification for Interoperability (TSI)*

### Definition {-}
With increasing digitalisation and automation in rail operations, many applications are being developed that will make it possible to significantly increase the attractiveness and efficiency of rail transport. Telematics applications are a functional subsystem of the railway that comprises two elements (European Commission, 2021):

  -	applications for freight services, including information systems (real-time monitoring of freight and trains), marshalling and allocation systems, reservation, payment and invoicing systems, management of connections with other modes of transport and production of electronic accompanying documents
  -	applications for passenger services, including systems providing passengers with information before and during the journey, reservation and payment systems, luggage management and management of connections between trains and with other modes of transport 

Telematics applications provide permanent interfaces and a constant dialogue between the train and the infrastructure at all stages of the process. The exchange of information between the infrastructure manager (IM) and the railway undertakings (RU) is essential for the success of telematics. The IMs modify and implement new IT tools to adapt the legacy systems to the requirements of the telematics applications TAF-TAP. The IT strategies and implementation plans of the IMs are, therefore, aligned with the requirements of the EU Railway Agency (ERA). As more stakeholders are involved in the use of telematics, they also define strategies, priorities and mandatory requirements taking into account the broader IT system landscape. In addition, IMs collect millions of data every day and invest in digitalisation to improve predictive maintenance of fixed assets and optimise the performance of their network. After all, efficient use of data could increase infrastructure capacities. Telematics applications will improve incident management (service interruptions), terminal operations such as shunting and intermodal operations, thus reducing operating costs (EIM, 2019).<br/>

Further, the basis for a smart and connected freight wagon is, in addition to telematics for geolocation and communication (satellite navigation, inertial and mobile radio systems), the use of sensors for condition recording and intelligent validation of driving and operating conditions (Ußler et al., 2019). In road transport, about 85% of trucks are equipped with telematics systems that monitor the condition of the vehicle, track its position and provide a direct communication with the driver via mobile phone. Fleet management receives real-time information and has redundant ways to communicate with the transport in case of problems. Rail freight traditionally operates its transports with infrastructure-based information sources. Therefore, wagons are usually not equipped with wagon-based monitoring and communication devices such as telematics systems and sensors. The result is a constant loss of time-critical goods to road transport (Behrends et al., 2016).  

### Key stakeholders {-}

- **Affected**: Mobile citizen, delivery companies and truck drivers, customers of online shops
- **Responsible**: National governments, private companies, public rail provider

### Current state of art in research {-}
[Single wagonload transport](https://blog.railcargo.com/de/artikel/einzelwagenverkehr) (SWL) that refers to a situation where individual wagons or groups of wagons from different consignors are bundled together to form one train, is an important component in the European rail transport system and in the logistics of various industries such as steel, chemicals and automotive. However, changing framework conditions and increasingly demanding market requirements have led to dramatic losses of market share and in some countries even to the complete discontinuation of the SWL business. As this business segment is also seen as an important part of the European co-modal transport system in the future, significant improvements are necessary. <br/> 

With on-board communication technology, freight operators can improve wagon dispatching and rescheduling processes in case of disruptions. Based on reliable online telematics data, dispatchers will be able to inform their customers about changes in the transport plan earlier, which will increase reliability and satisfaction of stakeholders. <br/>

Cost-efficient and intelligent telematics-based information services allow wagons to be tracked in real time and automatically present wagon mileage information. The telematics data service generates the necessary information required for reliable quality recording. This additional information optimises the current six-year life cycle of freight wagons. <br/>

With respect to passenger services, Müller et al., (2020) investigate the effect of unexpected disruptions and information times on public transport passengers. It is demonstrated that transport operators can minimize the negative impact of unplanned disruptions by informing their passengers as soon as possible once the disruption has occurred, because travel times increase drastically when passengers are informed too late.

### Current state of art in practice {-}
A group of freight rail industry stakeholders in the US announced the formation of Rail Pulse, a joint venture in late 2020 to create a technology platform which will facilitate and accelerate the adoption of GPS and other telematics technologies in the North American railcar fleet. Rail Pulse partners are focused on promoting the adoption of telematics on two fronts:

-	Rail safety, with the early phase of the platform focused on handbrake and impact data, which they believe could provide important safety data points for railways, car owners and shippers, coupled with a forward-looking approach to telematic features such as on-board bearing temperature and wheel impact detection sensors;
-	Improve the competitive position of rail compared to other modes by improving visibility of the status, location and condition of individual wagons, with telematic capabilities including data collection to support real-time track-level visibility of whether doors or hatches are open, whether the wagon is loaded or partially loaded and other key performance indicators.<br/>

Development of the Rail Pulse platform was expected to begin by the end of 2020, with a full service platform available to the North American railcar industry by the end of 2022 (Berman, 2020).
An investment in wagon telematics results in lower costs and higher turnover. One of the critical indications for a large implementation of telematics seems to be the fact that all three parties - shippers, railways and wagon keepers - will share the benefit of "lower costs". But this distribution of benefits may also lead to a "wait and see" behaviour of many railway stakeholders compared to their competitors on the road (Behrends et al., 2016). <br/>

Thus far, a significant cost reduction was achieved with new GSM and GPS modules. Interfaces for supplementary sensors such as impact detection, digital/analogue inputs/outputs, etc. were integrated. Furthermore, based on the analysis of user requirements, the development of a reliable load-sensing technology for freight wagons was started. This requirement emerged from the fact that today most freight wagons in railway operation do not use their full load capacity, as there is no cost-effective way to measure the load, especially during the filling process, e.g. in the area of bulk goods. If the wagons were to be overloaded and then moved by a train, all wheelsets would have to be replaced during costly inspection in a workshop. As a result, the freight wagon is not filled to its maximum payload, which leads to lower capacity and higher costs. To optimise the dispatching processes, the wagons transmit their loading status so that the dispatchers can re-dispatch the wagon in a short time after unloading, resulting in shorter downtimes and higher efficiency of the wagons (Behrends et al., 2016).

Regarding rail telematics for passenger services, Victoria (Australia) is introducing a real-time crowded train tool. Commuters travelling on Melbourne's rail network can now see in advance how crowded selected stations and trains are thanks to a new online tool called *RideSpace*. However, the data collected by the passenger counting sensors and predictive modelling technology has yet to be made available to third parties so they could use it in their journey planning apps. The tool displays current and predicted levels of "*train, station and platform occupancy*" on city lines, using symbols that range from "*very quiet to very full*". Similar technology is already being used in NSW to show real-time seat availability on Waratah trains so passengers can pre-empt potential overcrowding. The tool was developed by NTT Data and Telstra Purple and uses unspecified data modelling and machine learning for real-time estimates of overcrowding. The tool is part of a two-pronged attempt by the government to get Melbourne residents back on public transport after last year's deadly Covid 19 outbreak. The government is also offering commuters a 30% discount on off-peak fares for three months. It is expected that the tool's capacity data will soon be made available to third-party travel planning apps, although the government did not indicate when this would happen. Public Transport Minister Ben Carrol said that the tool puts the information Victorians need to make smart travel decisions directly into their hands (Hendry, 2021).
