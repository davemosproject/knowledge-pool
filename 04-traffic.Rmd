Speed limits are based on safety, mobility and environmental considerations. While fixed speed limits represent the appropriate speed for average conditions, variable or dynamic speed limits (DSL) take account of the real time traffic, or the road and weather conditions. Therefore, the latter reflect the safe speed better (Mobility and Transport, 2020). The road users are typically informed of the current speed limit by electronic signs above or beside the lanes (De Pauw et al., 2018), as shown in figure 1. These can be supplemented with warning signs (dynamic signage system). For example, if the usual speed limit is 100 km/h, the DSL could change to 80 km/h and further to 60 km/h, to limit rear-end collisions, if there is e.g., a traffic jam ahead or weather conditions are difficult.

With respect to the impact on the societal level, a Belgian study, by E. De Pauw et al. showed a significant decrease (-18 %) in the number of injury crashes after the introduction of a DSL system (De Pauw et al., 2018). F.G. Habtemichael and L. de Picado Santos (2013) found that a DSL system has the highest safety benefit during highly congested traffic conditions. The operational benefit in turn was the highest during lightly congested traffic conditions. However, the success of DSL is highly dependent on the level of driver compliance (Habtemichael & de Picado Santos, 2013). Besides the safety aspects, the goal of DSL is to harmonize the traffic flow. Heavy traffic can cause shock waves, which result in longer travel times and large variations in the speeds of the vehicles. The latter again may lead to unsafe situations. By using DSL this phenomenon could be reduced (Hegyi et al., 2005). Traffic flow efficiency can be improved more, when DSL is combined with coordinated ramp metering (Carlson, 2010). Speed limits can also be temporary lowered, due to high emission values. If the emission values combined with the amount of traffic, reach a specific level, the DSL-System responds automatically and lowers the speed limit for a certain time. How high that level is, depends on the local policies (ASFiNAG, 2019c).

### Current state of art in research {-}
Studies show, that in retrospect most DSL implementations in Europe were efficient traffic safety and flow improvement. In the United States the increase in safety was significant as well, but the flow improvement was controversial (Lu & Shladover, 2014). Hassan et al. (2012) discovered that during bad weather conditions the combination of Changeable Message Signs (CMS) and DSL was the best way to improve safety. Current research shows that the benefits of DSL systems could be improved by integrating it in a fully connected vehicles (CV) environment (Wu et al., 2020). Currently, research focuses on the integration of C-ITS, to connect the infrastructure to the vehicles. European standards should be developed during the next years (Erhart, 2019). 

### Current state of art in practice {-}
DSL systems are implemented and used around the world. The used algorithms differ, however. DSL integrated with C-ITS has been implemented in a test environment (Erhart, 2019). 
Austrian motorways are managed by the ASFiNAG - currently they have 17 DSL systems in use. That means that about 19 % of the Austrian Motorway-System are currently equipped by an DSL system (ASFiNAG, 2019a). So, there is potential for expansion. One global player in traffic management is the Austrian company Kapsch TrafficCom. Worldwide they have implemented their systems on more than 3.500 km of motorway (Kapsch TrefficCom). Kapsch TrafficCom's approximately 5,000 employees generated revenues of EUR 738 million in the fiscal year 2018/19.

## Urban access management

### Synonyms {-}
*Access Regulation Schemes (ARS), Urban Vehicle Access Regulations (UVARs), Low Emission Zones (LEZ), Access Restrictions, Traffic Restrictions, Limited Traffic Zones, Permit Schemes*

### Definition {-}
Urban Access Management can be seen as regulations, restrictions or bans, for traffic entering cities. Factors like congestion, air pollution, traffic noise or damage to historic buildings are influencing the liveability of cities negatively. Therefore, many cities have been introducing Access Regulation Schemes (ARS) with the goal of less vehicles entering the particular city or area. Implementing a pedestrian zone, is the simplest type of ARS and can improve the attractiveness of tourist attractions or shopping streets significantly (Sadler Consultants Europe GmbH, n.d. c). ARS can be differentiated by vehicle type, vehicle weight, by type of trip (e.g. delivery), by driver (e.g. residents or access), or applies to all vehicles (Sadler Consultants Europe GmbH, n.d. c). Furthermore, ARS can be static or dynamic, depending, for example, on the time of the day or air pollution levels. A list below provides examples of current measures used in the urban areas: 

-	Low Emission Zones (LEZ)
-	Limited Access Zones 
-	Urban Toll Schemes / Congestion Charging (CS)
-	Emergency Air Pollution Schemes
-	Zero Emission Zones (ZEZ)
-	Other Access Regulations (like Limited Traffic Zones, Through traffic bans, `Superblocks´ etc.)
-	Smaller Regulations / Restrictions (like school streets or shared spaces) (Sandler Consultants Europe GmbH, n.d. d). 

Solutions for ARS can be enforced by physical barriers or cameras, based on automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems and/or dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) technology, using on-board units (OBUs) (Kapsch TrafficCom., n.d. b) or by police or local authority officers (Sadler Consultants Europe GmbH, n.d. c). <br/>

The impact of Urban Vehicle Access Regulations differs according the implemented schemes, but several common goals are addressed:
-	Air quality improvement
-	Traffic congestion reduction
-	Urban landscape preservation (historical town centres)
-	Climate change mitigation
-	Quality of life
- Noise mitigation
-	Road safety
-	Raising revenues (Sandler Consultants Europe GmbH, n.d. d). 

In Austria, several cities and regions have implemented Low Emission Zones (LEZ) for lorries. For example, the city of Salzburg has Access Regulations (AR) for the city centre in place, so only vehicles with a specific reason (delivery or police) are allowed to enter. On the other hand, Tirol introduces occasionally traffic bans during the summer months (Sandler Consultants Europe GmbH, n.d. a). While, the city of Vienna aims at implementing a traffic-calmed city centre by 2022 (Stadt Wien, 2020).


### Key stakeholders {-}

- **Affected**: Car Users – especially users of old or high polluting cars, truck drivers, Shippers/producers, Wholesalers, Logistics providers, Retailers, Consumers, Citizens, Authorities
- **Responsible**: Municipalities, Road Operators, Urban Traffic Management, Authorities

### Current state of art in research {-}
Current research addresses the evaluation of UVAR implementations and identifies their positive and negative effects. For example, Lopez (2018) found that Urban Consolidation Centres (UCCs), Cargo Bikes (CBs) and Off-hour Deliveries (OHDs) are the three preferred types of solutions to assist in mitigating unwanted side-effects of UVARs on the logistic sector. Further, current research focuses on the sustainable urban planning in cites affected by mass tourism (García Hernández, 2019; Nolasco‐Cirugeda, 2020). Additionally, most recent area of research deals with geofencing that aims at creating digital zones defined on a map, with specific rules, that can be transmitted to the vehicles (Arnesen et al., 2020).

### Current state of art in practice {-}
According to Lopez (2018) there are the two preferred UVAR schemes: Low Emission Zones (LEZ) and Congestion Charging (CC). The implementation of these schemes is widely spread within Europe but follows different approaches. Lopez (2018) identified two dominant LEZ enforcement models, first visual surveillance using windscreen stickers and second, cameras with ANPR technology. Furthermore it is argued that *“It is very important to consider that the degree of impact of each measure not only varies from city to city but also depends on the presence of a mix of access regulations“* (Lopez, 2018).
