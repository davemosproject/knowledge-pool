This knowledge pool is driven by the fact that automation and digitalisation are progressing quickly, although not uniformly across all areas within transport context. Therefore, to understand spectrum of possibilities that they bring, it is necessary to explain key concepts, demonstrate their level of maturity and current market penetration, and finally assess their impact on different levels. Given this approach, the page of each topic contains the following elements:definition of the phenomenon, key stakeholders who are the main parties responsible for and affected by the given technological development. Then, we include two subsections on current state of art in research and practice. The former one summarizes the most recent research in a given topic while the latter explains the current stage of implementation of given technology in the real world. Further, section named relevant initatives in Austria covers the leading initaitives within given topic and potential for Austrain actors. Moreover, we provide the summary table of the impacts of the concept on selected sustainable development goals (SDGs). Beyond, to provide an objective measure of technology maturity within each topic we include so-called technology readiness scale (Willismson &amp; Beasley, 2011) and societal readiness scale, as described below: Figure 1.1: Technology readiness scale Figure 1.2: Societal readiness scale Finally, we provide a list of outstanding questions and links to additional sources on the topic.

Only automated driving vehicles are allowed to drive on these lanes. The typical applications include cooperative and adaptive cruise control based on sensors with the infrastructure, lane keeping, fuel use optimization and road pricing possibilities (Broek et al., 2011). The introduction of dedicated lanes for CAV is expected to have direct consequences on the traffic flow on the highways and a nearby road network. In particular, a study conducted in Singapore showed that dedicated lanes on the highways can reduce travel time of CAVs by approximately 25% (if the saturation on the lane is not reached) at the cost of a delay for conventional cars of approximately 7%, due to the reduced capacity (Ivanchev et al., 2017). They were also demonstrated to have a positive effect on fuel consumption. Moreover, the throughput, defined as a number of vehicles passing through the road in a given time interval, increased as a result of introduction of dedicated lanes for AVs (Kumar et al., 2020). This effect, however, was associated with a decrease in throughput of smaller roads due to the preference of AVs for highways because of time savings, which in turn can result in time loss for conventional cars. What is more, the benefits from increased capacity of AV-only lanes can be further amplified through setting a higher speed limits for these lanes (Ye &amp; Yamamoto, 2018). With respect to the demand for different road types the study found that the introduction of dedicated CAV lanes will increase the demand of conventional cars for major road (but smaller than highways) and minor roads as a substitution for more congested highways due to the dedicated AV lanes. In contrast, study by Chen et al. (2016) showed that the implementation of CAV dedicated lanes has a potential of maximizing traffic capacity on these lanes in a mix-traffic context while having effectively no impact on conventional traffic capacity. Further, in order to use efficiently CAV dedicated lanes, which may be underutilized at the early stage, it is proposed to allow conventional cars to enter the AVs-only lanes after toll payment. This solution stems from currently operational across the world High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes. This joint approach is claimed to improve the throughput of individual road as well as enhance system-wide flow distribution within the network (Liu &amp; Song, 2019). 2.1.3 Key stakeholders Affected: Conventional Cars Drivers, Car Manufacturers, Insurers Responsible: Road Infrastructure Agencies, Local and National Governments 2.1.4 Current state of art in research Current research focuses on gathering the evidence of the impact of the introduction of dedicated lanes on traffic flow, driver behavior adoption, safety and efficiency. Furthermore, it analyses the factors which influence them, by testing different design and operation configurations, road types and utilization policies (Rad et al., 2020). Both, field operational testing and driving simulator studies have been conducted to investigate the influence of different designs of dedicated lanes on drivers in conventional cars and those featuring some degree of automation (Guin et al., 2008, Zhong, 2018). In particular, a number of studies compared distinct access types of dedicated lanes (Zhong, 2018, Yang et al., 2019). They showed that dedicated lanes with limited access performed better in terms of travel time and throughput compared to dedicated lanes with continuous access. Moreover, the probability of vehicles platooning was significantly higher on dedicated lanes with limited access. On the other hand, it was showed that collision rates near the entry or exit of these limited access lanes are higher (Rad et al. 2020). 2.1.5 Current state of art in practice Currently state of Michigan together with several private partners including Ford and Alphabet Inc. are planning to dedicate 65 km of a highway between Detroit and Ann Arbor for the sole movement of autonomous vehicles including buses and shuttles (Krisher &amp; Eggert, 2020). Similar initiatives are taking place in other countries, for instance, China set out to build nearly 100 km of 8-lane highway linking Beijing and the Xiongan New Area, from which 2 lanes will be allocated for the automated traffic. The completion of the construction phase is predicted by the end of 2020, while its opening is for traffic is expected in June 2021 (Syncedreview.com, 2020). In Europe, there is on-going SHOW (SHared automation Operating models for Worldwide adoption) project which aims to deploy about seventy automated vehicles in 21 European cities. To assess how they can best be integrated vehicles will be used in different settings in mixed traffic and dedicated lanes. However, for safety reasons the driver will be on-board (CORDIS, 2020). 2.1.6 Relevant initiatives in Austria https://www.tugraz.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Institute/IHF/Projekte/ENABLE-S3_SummaryofResults_May2019.pdf https://www.ait.ac.at/themen/verkehrssicherheit-und-unfallforschung/projects/via-autonom/ 2.1.7 Impacts with respect to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Impact level Indicator Impact direction Goal description and number Source Individual Fuel consumption reduced + Environmental sustainability (7,12-13,15) Ivanchev et al., 2017 Individual Travel time reduced + Sustainable economic development (8,11) Zhong, 2018;Yang et al., 2019 Systemic Collision rate reduced + Health &amp; Wellbeing (3) Zhang et al., 2020 Systemic Emissions rate reduced + Environmental sustainability (7,12-13,15) Al Alam at al., 2010 Systemic Congestion ~ Sustainable economic development (8,11) Ivanchev et al., 2017;Kumar et al., 2020 Systemic Novel designs tested + Innovation &amp; Infrastructure (9) Guin et al., 2008;Zhong, 2018;Krisher &amp; Eggert, 2020 Systemic SHOW EU initiative + Partnership &amp; collaborations (17) CORDIS, 2020 2.1.8 Technology readiness level 5-6 2.1.9 Societal readiness level TBD 2.1.10 Open questions What are the potential benefits of dedicated AV lanes when coupled with smart platooning strategies? How and to what degree will joint concepts by automotive sector, fleet and road operators will improve traffic management establishing dynamic traffic regulations even across borders? What are the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders of physical infrastructure for connected and automated vehicles? Should the vehicle cope with any road infrastructure, and if not, what demands can be set to adapt the existing infrastructure? How to ensure continuity between those different environments? Which tools (e.g. micro- and macroscopic transport modelling, impact assessment) can enable cities to assess the impact of automated vehicles on their physical road infrastructure and balance the needs of automated vehicles against the needs of existing modes (conventional vehicles, public transport, pedestrians and cyclists).
