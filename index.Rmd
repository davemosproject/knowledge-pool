# Preface {-}

This is a *continuously developing* database, which is a part of [DAVeMOS](https://www.davemos.online/){target="_blank"} project. It aims at gathering concepts and evidence of the systemic impact of transport digitalisation and automation. Therefore, the authors of this work welcome any feedback, questions and contributions that the readers may have. <br/>

For further inputs please contact the corresponding author *Martyna Bogacz* on the following email address: davemos.library@boku.ac.at <br/>

The knowledge pool was last compiled on:
