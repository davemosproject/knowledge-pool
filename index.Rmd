Knowledge pool is a continuously developing database, which is a part of the [DAVeMoS](https://www.davemos.online/){target="_blank"} project. It aims at gathering concepts and evidence of the systemic impact of transport digitalisation and automation. It is a collaborative effort of DAVeMoS team members who contributed with their expertise, ideas and improvement suggestions regarding the content and design:

- Dr. Martyna Fidler
- B.Sc. Gregor Husner
- B.Sc. Veronika Hebenstreit
- B.Sc. Eva-Maria Unger
- Univ. Prof. Dr. Yusak Susilo


The authors welcome any feedback, questions and contributions that the readers may have. For further inputs please contact the corresponding author Martyna Fidler on the following email address: davemos.library@boku.ac.at. <br/>
