### Definition {-}
The transport sector will soon experience a revolution in automated driving systems (ADS), as reported by Wadud et al. (2016) and Fl√§mig (2016). Some benefits in terms of user experience, efficiency, safety, mobility, productivity, energy, environment and economy have been reported with ADS by many studies (Alessandrini et al., 2015; Anderson et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2014; Chan, 2017; Harper et al., 2016; Wadud, 2017; Kopelias et al., 2020 and Khan et al., 2019), although significant increases in road safety from highly or fully automated vehicles are not certain, as shown by Kalra & Paddock (2016).<br/>

The goals and motivations of automated driving for passenger cars and freight transport differ greatly (Wadud, 2017; Nowakowski et al., 2015). For passenger cars, the main motivations are user experience and the environment, while for freight, the main drivers are productivity and profitability. For example, the increase in the cost of a vehicle related to automation hardware is less important in freight transport due to the lower share of automation hardware costs in the total acquisition costs compared to those of passenger cars. In addition, ADS enable higher profitability in freight transport, mainly due to a reduction in labour costs as well as facilitated logistics and increased utilisation and efficiency (Wadud et al., 2016). In addition, driver costs decrease significantly with high or full automation of driving, leading to early adoption of ADS in the freight sector (Ghandriz et al., 2020a).<br/>

The levels of automation are currently divided into 5 levels (Paulsen, 2018):

**First level: assisted driving**

Individual assistance systems provide support for specific driving tasks. Assisted driving is already a reality in many cars today. (see automatic adaptive cruise control and automatic lane departure warning).

**Second level: partially automated driving**

With semi-automated driving, the car/truck can temporarily perform some tasks itself - without any human intervention. For this purpose, various individual systems are combined with each other - in this case, the automatic adaptive cruise control with the emergency braking and lane departure warning systems. Further level 2 functions (overtaking assistant, automatic parking)

**Third level: highly automated driving**

Highly automated cars/trucks (Level 3) can perform certain driving tasks autonomously and without human intervention, but only for a limited period of time and under suitable conditions specified by the manufacturer. Level 3 cars will probably be on the road on motorways first: There is no oncoming traffic there, the lane markings are usually in order, and the roads are continuously recorded as digital maps. Since 2017, there has also been a legal framework for Level 3 cars in Germany: as soon as the driver puts his car into highly automated mode, he is allowed to turn his attention away from the road traffic. This means that the driver is allowed to read the newspaper. 
However, if the system detects a problem and sends a signal, the driver must take over the wheel immediately. 

**Level four: fully automated driving**

In the development departments of the large car companies, but also at Apple, Google or Uber, engineers and computer scientists are working flat out on the full automation of the car, i.e. level 4 on the way to autonomous driving. In this level, the technical systems carry out all driving tasks automatically, and the car can also cover longer distances without intervention.
So far, however, there is no legal framework for fully automated vehicles.

**Fifth level: autonomous driving**

The fifth is the final level of autonomous driving. The car is now completely guided by the system and performs all the necessary tasks automatically. Even complex situations - such as crossing an intersection, driving through a roundabout or the correct behaviour at a zebra crossing - can be handled by the autonomous car. <br/>

So far, however, there is no legal framework for autonomous vehicles. Therefore, the rights and obligations of the manufacturers of the cars/trucks, software developers and the insurance companies, in the automated mode of operation, are still completely unclear. The ADAC experts suggest only *3 operating modes* instead of 5 levels (Paulsen, 2018), where at the moment the car supports us (1st operating mode), soon it will drive itself (2nd operating mode) and in future driverless (3rd operating mode). They can be described as follows:

**First mode: assisted driving**

The driver is always and at all times responsible for driving. As far as possible, the vehicle keeps in lane, brakes and accelerates. But: feedback is not mandatory and a sudden stop is always possible. 

**Second mode: automated driving**

The vehicle only drives itself in the application case specified by the manufacturer (e.g. stop-and-go in a traffic jam). The driver may temporarily turn away from the driving task and the traffic situation. Outside employment is possible. The driver is only liable if he has not complied with the request to take over.

**Third mode: autonomous driving**

The driver becomes a passenger, or the vehicle can be operated without occupants. The autonomous mode can be limited to defined routes. An operator (not the driver) must constantly monitor the vehicle in order to be able to react to operational problems (flat tyres, etc.).<br/>

For a regulatory framework, seamless and harmonised cross-border EU and national regulation of automated road transport is seen by the European Commission, 2019 as a key factor for market introduction. Common procedures for testing, validation and certification enable the standardisation of solutions. Standards should also apply to data exchange and communication solutions. Ethical, legal, environmental and safety aspects should be regulated. The liability and responsibility of each actor in the road system must be defined before the introduction of automated driving.

### Current state of art in research {-}
The reduction in fuel consumption achieved with ADS due to improved vehicle use and controlled energy management is only up to 10% for passenger cars compared to when a human driver is involved, depending on the traffic scenario (Mersky & Samaras, 2016). The reduction in fuel consumption achieved with ADS is likely to be higher in freight transport, considering that heavy vehicles can form platoons, which theoretically reduce the energy intensity of the following vehicle by up to 25% when the distance between vehicles reaches zero, according to (Wadud et al., 2016); while measurements showed average fuel savings of 8% and 15% for 10 m and 4 m distance of the trucks in the platoon, respectively, according to (Tsugawa et al., 2016). However, as the European Commission (2016) points out, heavy-duty vehicles contribute to about 25 % of CO2 emissions from road transport in Europe, which are rising due to increasing road freight transport despite improved fuel efficiency. These figures suggest that the efficiency improvements offered by ADS, although a profitable business, cannot lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions in the long term; therefore, a further reduction of emissions in the transport sector is needed, motivating the development of greener solutions (Ghandriz et al., 2020a).<br/>

In a slightly simplified study of ADS in heavy vehicles, a reduction in the total cost of ownership (TCO) of trucks of between 27% and 46% for battery electric heavy vehicles (BEHVs) and between 11% and 41% for combustion-powered heavy vehicles (CHVs) makes BEHVs more profitable than BEHVs with human drivers by a factor of four over longer distances. It was observed that Level 4-5 automated BEHVs tend to have lower optimal speeds than vehicles with human drivers. Furthermore, it was shown that reducing speed for safety reasons is less costly to implement for Level 4-5 automated BEHVs than for Level 4-5 automated CHVs; in many scenarios, low speeds up to 60 km/h even reduced the TCO. The reduction in TCO in Level 4-5 automated trucks was mainly achieved by eliminating driver pay (35%-55%), increasing road travel time (0%-15%), increasing payload by eliminating the cab (1.2%-5%), and optimising the drive system (0%-20%) (Ghandriz et al., 2020a). All the data and figures obtained were made available in (Ghandriz et al., 2020b) and provide valuable information on the feasibility and profitability of a planned freight transport operation with automation and electrification for a specific use case.<br/>

Pribyl et al., (2020) are investigating the effects of lower CAV penetrations. According to this, even with a low number of CAVs on the roads, the impact on transport and environmental performance indicators will be significant. However, this integration needs to be combined with other measures and policies such as the promotion of alternative powertrains if EU emission targets are to be met. However, results have also shown that CAVs can negatively affect other traffic parameters and lead, for example, to delays and other traffic flow phenomena.<br/>

Shin et al., (2018) analyse some of the technical trends related to intermodal automated freight transport systems (ATFS) that aim to reduce greenhouse gases and particulate matter, minimise infrastructure costs and logistics costs, and alleviate traffic congestion. Countries such as the US, Germany, the Netherlands and Japan have been actively developing technologies for ATFS.
Gan et al., 2021 capture the characteristics of the swarm intelligence of truck drivers as a solid basis for the design, control and management of the future driverless truck swarm robotics system. The detection of the short-term location of truck drivers in advance, especially for areas with high freight demand, and thus the optimal use of freight capacity on the motorway, is the key component of freight matching. For city-level forecasting, it can help to determine the city points that truckers will be driving to, making it easier to plan an optimal route for them from the city's perspective. It can also predict the internal transport capacity of the city, predict the bottleneck caused by the truck and provide decisions for inner-city traffic management.

Mulholland et al., (2018) define a global assessment of the decarbonisation of road freight transport by 2050. Overall, global road freight transport in tonnes-kilometer (tkm) is projected to grow 2.4-fold over the period 2015-2050 in their Reference Technology Scenario (RTS), with developing countries accounting for most of the growth, in line with economic growth. Developing countries are projected to account for 75% of road freight transport in 2050. In order to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, three key requirements are proposed:

-	Fuel economy standards (minimum efficiency).
-	Support for comprehensive data collection and information exchange
-	Promoting the use of alternative fuels and the vehicles that use them

### Current state of art in practice {-}
The initial introduction of autonomous driving in closed traffic systems (e.g. traffic in a system network) and manageable scenarios (e.g. motorway, airport grounds, ports) helps to overcome the reluctance towards the technologies as well as the lack of standardisation. The gradual introduction of platooning, starting with manned lead and follow vehicles, could build up the necessary acceptance among the population. It should be examined whether the simultaneous introduction of overhead electric trucks and thus the creation of a dedicated lane would make sense in terms of capacity and safety requirements (Fl√§mig, 2016).<br/>

A European Commission, 2019 report presents many automated road projects, but only one that deals specifically with freight transport:

-	Ensemble (01/06/2018- 31/05/2021)

The project aims to support the implementation of multi-brand truck platooning on European roads, so that a single truck can form a platoon with any other truck.

Other projects may approach the issue in a different way, but the focus is on all vehicles. For example:

-	Headstart (01/01/2019- 31/12/2021)

The project aims to define test and validation procedures for specific functionalities of Connected and Automated Driving (CAD), including key technologies such as communication, cyber security and positioning. The tests will take place both in simulation and in the real world to validate safety and security performance.

-	Levitate (01/12/2018- 30/11/2021)

The project will develop a wide-ranging assessment framework to evaluate the impact of connected and automated transport (CAT) on all aspects of transport and individual mobility, as well as at a societal level. The project addresses the needs of local authorities, regional authorities and national governments to prepare for the increasing use of connected and automated systems, to understand the implications for mobility policy and to take the most effective measures to achieve broader societal goals.<br/>

In the US four manufacturers that dominate the US long-haul truck market have all begun to look at a driverless future. In 2019-2021, each of them has signed contracts with one of the three leading developers of self-driving vehicles (Alphabet's Waymo, TuSimple Holdings and Aurora Innovation). Aurora plans to sell its driverless technology as a service, similar to the way jet engine makers charge airlines for hours spent on the throttle. TuSimple and Waymo Via have similar plans and are also operating cargo services while they test their technology. None of the partnerships with manufacturers are exclusive. The flurry of activity around trucking reflects a growing consensus that self-driving cars are still a long way from reaching most roads, and that 18-wheel trucks might be a better place to establish the technology. Long-haul trucks drive straight most of the time on highways without traffic lights, cyclists or pedestrians crossing the road (Boudway, 2021).

Self-driving vehicles could have an immense impact on logistics and supply chain management. This is because autonomous trucks, last-mile delivery robots and other AVs fit into an increasingly automated distribution process. The automation of high-volume freight routes has the potential to deliver huge efficiency gains in terms of improved safety, increased capacity, lower operating costs and reduced environmental impact. An analyst at Gartner predicts that while self-driving trucks won't be commercially available until 2024 at the earliest, supply chain executives responsible for transportation should start preparing for an autonomous future now. After all, autonomous trucks are just one part to fully automating the entire supply chain, from autonomous inventory planning to autonomous shipping to autonomous distribution. In a report (March 2021), a market research firm predicted that autonomous trucks will be more widely deployed by 2030, accounting for more than 10% of new heavy-duty truck sales on the road. By 2028, one-fifth of the world's countries will have active regulations allowing the legal operation of production-ready autonomous vehicles, up from zero in 2019 (Eddy, 2021).

**Societal aspect**

Despite the imminent technical possibility of implementation, society may not be quite ready for it and political opposition because of the potential for large-scale unemployment among commercial drivers is expected (Wadud, 2017). Whereas, according to the IRU (International Road Transport Union), the European road transport sector is facing the biggest shortage of professional drivers in decades in 2019. According to a survey, the reasons are: the lack of attracting women to work in transport (female drivers make up only 2 per cent of employees in the European transport sector), attracting young people to work in the industry, the poor image of the profession, poor working conditions and being away from home and family for too long. In addition, there is the demographic ageing of the workforce. The average age of a truck driver in Europe is 44 (Kulikowska-Wielgus, 2019).<br/>

In the US, federal agencies have filed plans with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a survey study to assess public appetite for automated driving systems (ADS) in the trucking sector. However, the project, Trucking Fleet Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for Managing Mixed Fleets, has already received public pressure. While the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) received only eight comments on the proposal when it was first requested in November, all opposed it. They cited the "potential loss of jobs for truck drivers and safety concerns arising from ADS testing in the real world" before enough simulator testing has been done. "People who rely on truck driving jobs will become unemployed and will no longer have a way to earn a living and provide for themselves and their families," one comment stated. If OMB approves the survey, a questionnaire will be completed before and after participants have the opportunity to have hands-on experience with ADS truck technology to assess a change in sentiment. The plan is to share these experiences at four "road shows" at existing trucking conferences around the country (Gallagher, 2021).<br/>

Since 2019, a fully electric autonomous truck "T-Pod" from Einride has been driving on a public road in Sweden on behalf of logistics service provider DB Schenker. However, the approval, which was valid until the end of 2020, stipulated that the T-Pod, which weighs up to 26 tonnes, may only travel at 5 km/h, that the approval was only valid for a specific public road in an industrial area and that one employee was assigned to each vehicle as a supervisor who can intervene from a distance via joystick in the event of problems. The truck was highly technical did not have a driver's cab. According to Einride, the e-truck offers space for 15 Euro pallets instead. Its regular maximum speed is capped at 85 km/h. A 280 kWh battery on board is supposed to guarantee a range of 200 km (Of-Allinger et al., 2020; Werwitzke, 2019). <br/>

In manageable, closed areas such as quarries or mines driverless vehicles are already being tested in practice. Volvo Trucks, for example, has six self-driving trucks in operation at a Norwegian limestone plant (B√∂hm, 2019).


### Relevant initiatives in Austria {-}
In Upper Austria (Gunskirchen), a driverless truck will soon also be on the road in public areas. Over the next three years, it will regularly cover the approximately 600-metre route between the logistics centre of DB Schenker Austria and the engine manufacturer BRP-Rotax. The route runs partly on factory premises and partly in public areas and is to be completed in all weathers. After completion of the test phase, the driverless electric transporter will then cover the route between DB Schenker's logistics centre and the BRP-Rotax company, which is mainly on the public road, completely autonomously from 2023. The electric vehicle is to complete the route in all weathers, whether wind, rain or snow. For freight transport, a classic diesel truck currently travels the same route several times a day (APA, 2021; DB, 2021).
