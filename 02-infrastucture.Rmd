## Dedicated lanes for connected and automated vehicles (CAV) {#dedicated_lanes}

### Synonyms {-}
*AV-dedicated lanes*, *dedicated corridors*

### Definition {-}
Dedicated lane for connected and autonomous vehicles features additional infrastructure or sensors to increase the reliability of Advanced Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS). Only automated driving vehicles are allowed to drive on these lanes. The typical applications include cooperative and adaptive cruise control based on sensors with the infrastructure, lane keeping, fuel use optimization and road pricing possibilities (Broek et al., 2011). The introduction of dedicated lanes for CAV is expected to have direct consequences on the traffic flow on the highways and a nearby road network. In particular, a study conducted in Singapore showed that dedicated lanes on the highways can reduce travel time of CAVs by approximately 25% (if the saturation on the lane is not reached) at the cost of a delay for conventional cars of approximately 7%, due to the reduced capacity (Ivanchev et al., 2017). They were also demonstrated to have a positive effect on fuel consumption. <br/><br/>
Moreover, the throughput, defined as a number of vehicles passing through the road in a given time interval, increased as a result of introduction of dedicated lanes for AVs (Kumar et al., 2020). This effect, however, was associated with a decrease in throughput of smaller roads due to the preference of AVs for highways because of time savings, which in turn can result in time loss for conventional cars. What is more, the benefits from increased capacity of AV-only lanes can be further amplified through setting a higher speed limits for these lanes (Ye & Yamamoto, 2018). With respect to the demand for different road types the study found that the introduction of dedicated CAV lanes will increase the demand of conventional cars for major road (but smaller than highways) and minor roads as a substitution for more congested highways due to the dedicated AV lanes. <br/><br/>
In contrast, study by Chen et al. (2016) showed that the implementation of CAV dedicated lanes has a potential of maximizing traffic capacity on these lanes in a mix-traffic context while having effectively no impact on conventional traffic capacity. Further, in order to use efficiently CAV dedicated lanes, which may be underutilized at the early stage, it is proposed to allow conventional cars to enter the AVs-only lanes after toll payment. This solution stems from currently operational across the world High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes. This joint approach is claimed to improve the throughput of individual road as well as enhance system-wide flow distribution within the network (Liu & Song, 2019).

### Current state of art in research {-}
Current research focuses on gathering the evidence of the impact of the introduction of dedicated lanes on traffic flow, driver behavior adoption, safety and efficiency. Furthermore, it analyses the factors which influence them, by testing different design and operation configurations, road types and utilization policies (Rad et al., 2020). Both, field operational testing and driving simulator studies have been conducted to investigate the influence of different designs of dedicated lanes on drivers in conventional cars and those featuring some degree of automation (Guin et al., 2008, Zhong, 2018). In particular, a number of studies compared distinct access types of dedicated lanes (Zhong, 2018, Yang et al., 2019). They showed that dedicated lanes with limited access performed better in terms of travel time and throughput compared to dedicated lanes with continuous access. Moreover, the probability of vehicles platooning was significantly higher on dedicated lanes with limited access. On the other hand, it was showed that collision rates near the entry or exit of these limited access lanes are higher (Rad et al. 2020).

### Current state of art in practice {-}
Currently state of Michigan together with several private partners including Ford and Alphabet Inc. are planning to dedicate 65 km of a highway between Detroit and Ann Arbor for the sole movement of autonomous vehicles including buses and shuttles (Krisher & Eggert, 2020). Similar initiatives are taking place in other countries, for instance, China set out to build nearly 100 km of 8-lane highway linking Beijing and the Xiongan New Area, from which 2 lanes will be allocated for the automated traffic. The completion of the construction phase is predicted by the end of 2020, while its opening is for traffic is expected in June 2021 (Syncedreview.com, 2020). In Europe, there is on-going SHOW (SHared automation Operating models for Worldwide adoption) project which aims to deploy about seventy automated vehicles in 21 European cities. To assess how they can best be integrated vehicles will be used in different settings in mixed traffic and dedicated lanes. However, for safety reasons the driver will be on-board (CORDIS, 2020).

### Synonyms {-}
*ERS*

### Definition {-}
Electric Road System (ERS) is a technological solution that is aimed at charging and transferring power from the road to the vehicles driving along that road. It can be considered an alternative for sustainable transport where it ssupports the use of hybrid and electric vehicles. There are three main types of ERS (Muelaner, 2020):

-	**Catenary Systems** are overhead lines suspended about 5 meters above the road which are typically used for trams and electric vehicles but sometimes can also be used along highways to power heavy commercial vehicles. Overhead lines are cheapest and the most mature form of ERS because of their resemblance with power systems used for railways or trams. They require vehicle to be equipped with pantograph which connects it with the line accommodating lateral and vertical movements. For this reason, catenary systems are the most suitable for large commercial vehicles and the lack of compatibility with small, private cars is considered a major disadvantage. What is more, the overhead lines provide a major hazard in case of road accidents for all road users. Moreover, they negatively impact the visual aspects within the areas in which they are installed, potentially posing issues for public acceptance (Muelaner, 2020). 

-	**Conductive tracks** are metal rails which are embedded on (or into) the road surface and provide power through a contact with a pick-up point underneath the vehicle. For safety reasons tracks are divided into small segments rather than continuous, so that the electrical connection is running only when the vehicle passes over them. In contrast to overhead lines, the conductive tracks can be used for vehicles of different sizes. Their advantage is also clear in terms of lower installation costs. Sweden has been a testing ground for larger scale use of this electric road system (Muelaner, 2020).

-	**Inductive tracks** are conductive coils which are placed below the surface of the road to provide energy by inducing an electric current in the coil placed under the vehicle driving along the track. Their advantage is smaller maintenance requirement as compared to conductive tracks, however, a system failure would require costly work to access underground infrastructure.<br/>

Overall, the wider use of ERS would reduce the need for construction of costly charging station, eliminate waiting time while the vehicle is charging, significantly increase driving range of hybrid and electric vehicles   and facilitate reduction in size of batteries installed in the private cars which directly translates into more efficient performance.

### Current state of art in research {-}
Current, research focuses on testing of the ERS solutions to enable deployment on a larger scale, extend applicability to a new type of vehicles, increase their efficiency and assess their transport decarbonization potential. <br/>

Since 2008 the South Korean company [OLEV](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/html/kaist/01200103.html) (branch of KAIST University) has been working on inductive power transfer and since 2013 two electric buses have been in operation on public roads, inside university campus (Kelion, 2013). Nonetheless, this system is currently outdated and results as a low-speed system within local public transport. In 2016 an initial testing of the overhead lines has been conducted in Germany on Siemens’ 2 km test track in Berlin, at the same time in Sweden a full integration with Scania vehicle has been achieved. More example include Volvo and Alstom’s cooparation on testing of conductive tracks on the 400 m test side in Hällered, Sweden (Möller, 2017). Similarly, Swedish Transport Administration in collaboration with Elonroad under [EVolution Road](https://www.evolutionroad.se/en/) project constructed a 1 km of demonstration road in Lund to test the performance of an electric bus. <br/>
On the other hand, research on the efficiency of inductive tracks conducted in France and Italy showed that their performance depends on the precision of alignment between the track and the coil in the vehicle (Muelaner, 2020). Finally, a study by Börjesson et al. (2020) showed that use of electric road solution can decrease operational costs for freight operators due to a switch from diesel to electricity. Consequently, the social benefit of this technological solution outweighs its cost. Moreover, it has been concluded that use of ERS offers significant reduction in carbon emissions.


### Current state of art in practice {-}
At the moment, there are multiple companies offering power technologies such as [Elways](https://elways.se/), [Alstom](https://www.alstom.com/) or [Elonroad](https://elonroad.com/), to name a few. The proliferation of such companies enabled active testing and implementation of different ERS solutions around the world. <br/>

Since 2016 overhead lines have been successfully deployed on public roads in Sweden (E16 highway outside Gävle) and the USA (City of Carson). Currently, in Germany three tests sponsored by Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety [(BMU)](www.bmu.de) are taking place. In Hesse and Schleswig-Holstein 5 km of motorway was electrified at the beginning of 2020 (Wettengel, 2019) while in Baden-Württemberg, 4 km of a national highway will have an overhead line system in operation at the beginning of 2021. For the moment, these overhead lines provide power to freight vehicles, however  an issue arises among the truck fleets going through Germany from Eastern Europe, because they are lacking modern hybrid trucks equipped with pantographs on the roof. <br/>

Further, between 2016-2017 project [VICTORIA]( https://www.fcirce.es/en/smart-mobility-en-en/victoria-2) led by Spanish energy company Endesa developed first dynamic inductive load systems for a bus line in Malaga, Spain. Similarly, EU project [FABRIC](https://trimis.ec.europa.eu/project/feasibility-analysis-and-development-road-charging-solutions-future-electric-vehicles) has been conducted in Torino, Italy and Satory in France (Tongur & Sundelin, 2016). <br/>

In terms of cost analysis, an example from the UK shows that inductive tracks provide cost advantage, where the installation of 1 mile (1,6 km) of inductive tracks on a two-lane road costs around 1.4 million euros. If these were to be installed in all UK highways the costs would come up to around 13 billion euros. At the same time, the cost of additional electricity capacity required for hydrogen in [FCEV](#FCEV) sums up to 140 billion euros. Additionally, cost-benefit analysis showed that if most vehicles used ERS, the savings resulting from smaller batteries in electric cars would outweigh the costs of ERS construction. <br/>

Interestingly, ERS has not been particularly popular in Austria, potentially due to presence of well-developed railway network which, thus far, dominated freight. In particular, critics describe the construction of electric highways as *a waste of money*, because it only benefits companies that equip their fleets with the necessary vehicles with overhead line system (Traktuell.at. 2020).

## High occupancy toll lanes {#high_occupancy}

## Public transport priority systems {#public_trans_priority}

### Synonyms {-}
*pre-emption of public transport vehicles, public transport priority (PTP), Transit signal priority (TSP), road-space priority (RSP)*

### Definition {-}
To encourage people to use public transport and thereby travel more sustainably, it is necessary that public transport operates reliably and efficiently. For example, public transport is the most efficient mode of transport at the intersections, where the difference in the number of people who can pass through a junction in a given time is particularly impressive between cars and public transport. The ratio is between 1 to 10 and 1 to 20 (Schwendinger, 2019). In contrast, a bus at full capacity that is stuck in congestion increases the travel time of many more passengers, compared to single cars in a similar position. Time delays due to traffic signals account for up to 25% of the total travel time of buses (Seredynski et al., 2015). Furthermore, energy prices and emissions generated become more relevant for public transport operators, to compete with the motorized private transport (Gassel et al., 2012).<br/><br/>
The implementation of public transport priority measures can help improving time and energy efficiency of public transport service. The delays caused by traffic signals can be reduced by the introduction of Transit Signal Priority (TSP) such as early green, green extension, phase rotation, phase insertion and actuated transit phase, favouring public transport (Seredynski et al., 2015). TSP systems can increase the attractiveness of public transport, reduce the operation cost and reduce tailpipe emissions and energy use. On the other hand, they increase the travel time of general traffic, therefore the acceptance is limited (Seredynski et al., 2015). Another widely used systems are separated bus lanes or independent tracks for trams. These are especially relevant in 30 km/h zones, so the public transport vehicles can be excluded from the regulation. But since space is a limited good, independent lanes or tracks are not always possible to implement (Schwendinger, 2019). <br/><br/>
For Vienna priority of public transport vehicles is of high importance (WIENER STADTWERKE GmbH, 2018). The first measures to shorten the travel time of the bus route 15A at Wienerberg took effect in Autumn 2018. Measures to give priority to public transport are also becoming more important in other cities such as Linz, Graz or Innsbruck. Trams in Graz have priority switching at almost all traffic lights, while there is a further need for bus lines, especially for those from the surrounding area (Schwendinger, 2019).To promote e-mobility, some countries introduced bus lane access to e-vehicles (Figenbaum et al., 2015). Wiener Linien is clearly against this measure, because cars, regardless of their propulsion system, cause delays in the bus lanes and slow down public transport (WIENER STADTWERKE GmbH, 2018).

### Current state of art in research {-}
Current research aims at building on the existing solutions such as TSP and proposes so-called Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) driver assistance systems. A multi segment GLOSA can take several lights in a sequence on route of a bus into account and allows the driver to adjust the speed, so that the bus can arrive at the intersection when the light is green. By that, the comfort of passengers can be increased and the fuel consumption as well as the tailpipe emissions be decreased, without negatively affecting the general traffic (Seredynski et al., 2014). However, Stahlmann et al. (2018) argue that so far, most GLOSA simulation studies are too optimistic in terms of communication performance and recommend further improvement of GLOSA systems. <br/><br/>
Moreover, the Green Light Optimal Dwell Time Advisory (GLODTA) systems look into exploiting additional dwell time at the near-side bus stop (Seredynski et al., 2014). According to Seredynski & Viti (2017) they can support on-route battery charging of electrical buses and also replace existing holding strategies used to regulate punctuality of bus services. <br/><br/>
Due the limited acceptance of TSP systems, more research regarding the efficient use of green time provided to public transport is needed. Therefore, the focus is on the improvement of the bus detection methods. The latest TSP are working with GPS-based Virtual Detectors (VD), which eliminate the need of on-street detection infrastructure, but their disadvantages is low accuracy (Seredynski et al., 2015).<br/><br/>
Haitao et al. (2019) developed an integrated and systematic framework for the optimization of bimodal urban networks using 3D-MFDs, considering the complexities of bimodality to manage traffic more efficiently and provide public transport priority. Results of the evaluation show that the proposed strategy always performs better than existing perimeter control schemes in terms of passenger mobility.  


### Current state of art in practice {-}
A common measure in use is the positioning of stops before intersections, which combines the standing time at the traffic lights with the passenger change and thus leads to travel time reductions (Schwendinger, 2019).<br/><br/>
All around the world Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems have gained popularity. Cervero (2013) defines them as “bus-based system that mimics the high-capacity, high-performance characteristics of urban rail systems at a much lower price” that runs either on exclusive transit-ways, dedicated bus lanes or some grade of separation. <br/><br/>
Regarding TPS, the cloud-based systems using GPS locations are standard technology (see Figure 1). However, there are still many outdated systems in use that are based on short-range radio. These systems require that all traffic lights are equipped with receivers. All buses in a fleet need special transmitters and an onboard system for positioning, which makes it an overall expensive system. At the same time, this technology is rather unreliable and maintenance intensive (SWARCO, 2021).

### Open questions {-}

1. Who is responsible for the implementation of PTP systems?
2. How will Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and in future Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) change PTP systems? 
3. How could also emergency vehicles be prioritised? 
4. How to deal with mixed fleets - half new, half old? 
5. What are the benefits compared to the costs? 
6. Which standards should be used?
